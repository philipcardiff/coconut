# Turek benchmark with OpenFOAM2D and KratosStructure2D

This example calculates the well-known Turek benchmark, which consist of laminar incompressible flow around a flexible flag attached to a rigid cylinder in a 2D channel.
The material parameters and boundary conditions correspond to the FSI2 setup, as detailed by Turek and Hron [[1](#1)].
The challenging aspect of this benchmark lies in the large self-induced oscillation of the flag.
The used solvers are OpenFOAM and Kratos Multiphysics Structural Mechanics application.
Furthermore, the script _`animate_beam.py`_ can be used to visualize the interface data throughout the calculation.
A video made with ParaView is shown below.

With these solver, the run time is significantly smaller than that of the same test case with [Fluent and Abaqus](../fluent2d_abaqus2d/turek_fluent2d_abaqus2d.md).
For details on boundary conditions and parameters refer to the example with [Fluent and Abaqus](../fluent2d_abaqus2d/turek_fluent2d_abaqus2d.md).

The accuracy of the simulation framework can be assessed by comparing with the results in Turek and Hron [[1](#1)].
A script _`evaluate_benchmark.py`_ is provided to extract the necessary quantities, which are given below using the format "mean value +/- amplitude [frequency]".

## Coupling algorithm

The coupling technique used is the *interface quasi-Newton algorithm with an approximation for the inverse of the Jacobian from a least-squares model* (IQN-ILSM).
The reuse parameter `q` is set to 10, which means that data from the last ten time steps will be used to stabilize and accelerate the convergence.

## Predictor

The initial guess in every time step is done using the quadratic predictor.

## Convergence criterion

Two convergence criteria have been specified:

-   The number of iterations in every time step is larger than 15.
-   The absolute norm of the displacement is lower than $10^{-7}$.
 
When either criterion is satisfied the simulation stops.

## Solvers

OpenFOAM is used as flow solver.
The provided mesh is quadrilateral.
Some finer mesh settings are provided in the blockMeshDict.

The structural solver is Kratos Multiphysics and uses first-order, quadrilateral, plane strain elements.

To exchange information between the solvers on the fluid-structure interface, the use of mappers is required.
In the structural solver wrapper, a linear interpolation mapper is used to interpolate in the x- and y-direction from and to the coupled solver.
