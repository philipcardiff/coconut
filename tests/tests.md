# Tests

> TODO: gives an explanation of how to run the tests, how and when tests should be added etc... 

This file should mention e.g. that for tests with Fluent, the software must be loaded in advance (and hence only one version can be tested at a time). Sth similar is probably true for the other solver wrappers?
