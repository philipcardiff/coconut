communication between Python (coCoNuT) and OF
----------------------------------------------

os.system ("touch next.coco") #creating of next.coco-file
=> Launching OpenFOAM with cmd = ...

=> go to OF and execute the script in CoCoNuT_pipmleFoam: if (exist("next.coco")
	-> create a next_ready.coco 

=> go to Python and end the while not loop with the file:(" next_ready.coco")

os.system ("touch continue.coco") #creating of continue.coco-file
=> go back to OF and execute: if (exist("continue.coco"))
	-> create a continue_ready.coco

 => go to Python and end the while not loop with the file:(" continue_ready.coco") 

=> Impose another displacement ( In this case are "we" the structural solver, the purpose is that we get the information of another solver)

=> Execute the command "decomposePar -fields
=> repeat the continuity loop again in OpenFOAM
	-> create a continue_ready.coco

os.system ("touch save.coco") #creating of save.coco-file

os.system (" reconstructPar")
